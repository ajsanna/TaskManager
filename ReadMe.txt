CS4080 Final Project: Task Manager 

Alex Sanna, John Hager, Ariana V. Taylor Knobloch

Description>
	A simple graphical interface that supports the displayal of TODO taskss 
each with their own corrosponding date, desc, and importance factor. The GI should also support the addition of new tasks to the toDo list, as well as the deletion of tasks as well. Modification of tasks is an optional feature we could add if time permits. The tasks should be saved to a memory system so that each time the program is loaded/stopped the tasks are saved and transfer accross runtimes. I think a simple way to do this would be to use a txt document that reads and writes to the program before displayal through the GI. 

First Step: Get the GUI set up and working with basic output. 
Second Step: Set up data collection through the GI: (textboxes, etc...)

Incoorperate the functionality described above, and finally link in the makeshift storage system for memory purposes.
